# Cinema Ticket Project

This is a simple Cinema Ticket application that allows users to browse movies, view details, and purchase tickets. The project consists of an HTML interface that displays movie information, and JavaScript functionality to handle fetching movie data, displaying it, and managing ticket purchases.

## Features
- **Movie List**: Displays a list of movies fetched from an API.
- **Movie Details**: When a user clicks on a movie title, detailed information (such as poster, runtime, description, showtime, and available tickets) is shown.
- **Buy Ticket**: Users can click the "Click to Purchase Ticket" button to purchase tickets, which decreases the remaining ticket count.
- **Sold Out Notification**: When there are no remaining tickets, the app displays a "Tickets are now Sold Out!" alert.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Semantic UI)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Fetch API (for retrieving movie data)

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
To run the project, all you need is a browser to view the `index.html` file. No server setup is required for the basic functionality, as the movie data is fetched from an external API.
